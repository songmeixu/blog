<h3 id="part-one">Part One</h3>

<p>One morning, when <em>Gregor Samsa</em> woke from troubled dreams, he <a href="./">found</a> himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</p>

<h3 id="part-two">Part Two</h3>

<p>It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn&rsquo;t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.</p>

<ul>
<li>He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there.</li>
<li>The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The light from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light">electric street lamps</a> shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark.</p>
