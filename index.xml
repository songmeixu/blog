      <title>Kaldi并行训练配置方式</title>

      <description>前言：在训练中，常需要根据任务是CPU还是GPU运算密集任务、IO读写任务，将任务分配到不同的服务机群，SGE提供了队列来应对这一需求。具体在kaldi环境中，切换队列有以下方法：
方法1 &amp;ndash; 直接修改cmd.sh： queue=all.q # 在这里指定队列 export train_cmd=&amp;quot;queue.pl -q $queue --mem 2G&amp;quot; export decode_cmd=&amp;quot;queue.pl -q $queue --mem 4G&amp;quot; export mkgraph_cmd=&amp;quot;queue.pl -q $queue --mem 8G&amp;quot;  方法2 &amp;ndash; 修改conf/queue.conf： kaldi解析SGE并行任务的脚本为queue.pl，其默认会读取配置文件conf/queue.conf，所以可以通过配置文件提供的选项来切换队列。（还可以完成限制内存占用、指定进程数、指定机器处理等等配置，如--mem 2G就是通过默认配置文件完成到qsub中-l mem_free=2G,ram_free=2G的转换）
以如下配置文件举例：
command qsub -v PATH -cwd -S /bin/bash -j y -l arch=*64* option mem=* -l mem_free=$0,ram_free=$0 option mem=0 # Do not add anything to qsub_opts option num_threads=* -pe smp $0 option num_threads=1 # Do not add anything to qsub_opts option max_jobs_run=* -tc $0 default gpu=0 option gpu=0 -q all.</description>

      <title>Good to Great Book Review</title>

      <description>I read Good to Great in January 2016. An awesome read sharing detailed analysis on how good companies became great. Although this book is about how companies became great but we could apply a lot of the learnings on ourselves. Concepts like level 5 leader, hedgehog concept, the stockdale paradox are equally applicable to individuals.</description>

      <description>Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.
Bool True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do.</description>

      <description>Part One One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
 He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
 The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

      <title>Use @ instead of HEAD</title>

      <description>I recently discovered that from git version 1.8.5 onwards, @ can replace HEAD:
$ git reset --hard @~2 $ git rebase -i @~10 $ git diff @~2..@~3 And also in most scenarios HEAD can be left out completely, so you can say:
$ git reset -- @{2} instead of:
$ git reset -- HEAD@{2} It takes some getting used to, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely faster than typing HEAD.</description>

      <description>Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>

      <description>The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction series created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it was later adapted to other formats, and over several years it gradually became an international multi-media phenomenon. Adaptations have included stage shows, a &amp;ldquo;trilogy&amp;rdquo; of five books published between 1979 and 1992, a sixth novel penned by Eoin Colfer in 2009, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 computer game, and three series of three-part comic book adaptations of the first three novels published by DC Comics between 1993 and 1996.</description>
